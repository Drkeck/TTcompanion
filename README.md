> Lets make a Table Top Companion app that usese the file system.. shall we?
This Tauri app is something i've wanted to build for a while but figuring out the specifics, as getting a file saving system
I could have gone with an Electron app but thought it might be a little overkill for the style of application i was designing as well as trying to keep the app as lightweight as i could.
While being lightweight it also allowed me to experiemnt with other technology and form my own opinion about what sort of experience developing in Tauri is and how it is better or worse than the alternatives while also avoiding running a databse structure in the app or on the personaly machine itself.



### built with
Tauri, React and Typescript in Vite.
